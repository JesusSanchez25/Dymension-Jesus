# CONTRIBUTING.md

### First steps to contribute 🚀

#### 1. Set up the environment 🖥️

- **Fork the repository**: Create a fork of the project to your Github account to have your own **personal copy**. To do this, click the "Fork" button on the Github project repository web.

- **Clone your fork**: After creating your fork, **clone** it on your machine. Integrate it with VSCode or Github Desktop.

- **Sync your fork**: Check from the web/Github Desktop that your fork contains all the recent changes made on the original repository. If you aren't up-to-date, make sure to sync and get the latest version. **Don't forget making a 'fetch'/'pull' from your local machine after syncing to apply al the new changes.**

#### 2. Work on your changes ✒️

- **RECOMMENDED - Create a new branch**: Before writing any code, create a new branch on your fork to better organize the changes made.
- **Implement your changes**: Use your local branch for this, making sure you keep **clean, commented and correcly formatted code**.
- **Test your changes**: Use 'Live Server' extension to easily preview the changes made, and make sure to create descriptive commits and finally push the changes to your **personal repository**.

#### 3. Send your changes 📤

- **Create a Pull Request (PR)**: In GitHub, go to your fork and clic **Contribute -> Pull Request** to create a new one (You could also use VSCode or Guthub Desktop). Make sure you clearly describe the changes implemented following the PR template.

### Best practices 🌟 

- **Make simple PRs**: Always try to make the least possible changes to the existing code in a single PR so that reviewers can easily identify the modifications implemented. You can always create more PRs for other changes.
- **Check existing issues**: Always make sure no one else has ssigned themselves the issue in question and that it is still open.
- **Use labels**: Add at least 1 label to your Issues or PRs to better organize the repository.
- **Follow the code formatting conventions**: Keep the tabs or spaces as they are in the code. Any minimal change can deeply affect the repository and cause conflicts.
- **Comment your code**: make sure to comment and document the code, at least to devide it into sections.
- **Update / Sync your fork frequently**: Always keep your fork up-to-date to prevent conflicts and see the latest changes.
